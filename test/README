Type "make" to run a selection of demos.

Type "make > TEST &" to get a record of the results in file TEST.

The results in TEST can then be compared to the results of
runs on other machines. Such results may already be in files
in the current directory. Apart from the listed CPU time, 
there should be no significant differences. 
In case of suspected portability problems send the file TEST
to doedel@cs.concordia.ca.

If the test fails completely (no AUTO output at all) then you
may have a Unix-related problem. First try to run a demo, e.g. ``ab''
in a clean directory (see the manual for details). If this demo
does not give results either then you may want to consult a system's 
analyst.
===================================================================
To run all runs of all demos, type "make all > TEST &"
In this very comprehensive test it is likely that some demos will
give somewhat different results on different machines. This is to
be expected for very sensitive calculations performed on machines
of different architecture. 
===================================================================
To run the HomCont demos only, type "make hom > TEST &"
