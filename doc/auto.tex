\subsection*{Preface}
This is a guide to the software package \AUTO
for continuation and bifurcation problems in ordinary differential 
equations.
Earlier versions of \AUTO were described in 
\citename{Do:81} \citeyear{Do:81},
\citename{DoKe:86} \citeyear{DoKe:86},
\citename{DoWa:95a} \citeyear{DoWa:95a},
\citename{WaDo:95b} \citeyear{WaDo:95b}.
For a description of the basic algorithms see
\citename{DoKeKe:91a} \citeyear{DoKeKe:91a},
\citename{DoKeKe:91b} \citeyear{DoKeKe:91b}.
This version of \AUTO incorporates the {\cal HomCont} algorithms of
\citename{ChKu:94} \citeyear{ChKu:94},
\citename{ChKuSa:95} \citeyear{ChKuSa:95}
for the bifurcation analysis of homoclinic orbits.
The graphical user interface was written by
\citename{XJW:94} \citeyear{XJW:94}.
The Floquet multiplier algorithms were written by
\citename{Fa:94} \citeyear{Fa:94},
\citename{FaJe:91} \citeyear{FaJe:91}.

\subsection*{Acknowledgments}
The first author is much indebted to H.~B.~Keller 
of the California Institute of Technology for his inspiration,
encouragement and support.
He is also thankful to \AUTO users and research collaborators who have 
directly or indirectly contributed to its development,
in particular, 
Jean Pierre Kern\'evez, UTC, Compi\`egne, France;
Don Aronson, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis; and 
Hans Othmer, University of Utah.
Material in this document related to the computation of connecting orbits
was developed with Mark Friedman, University of Alabama, Huntsville.
Also acknowledged is the work of Nguyen Thanh Long,
Concordia University, Montreal, on the graphics program {\cal PLAUT} and the 
pendula animation program.
An earlier graphical user interface for \AUTO on SGI machines was written by 
\citename{TaKe:89} \citeyear{TaKe:89}.
Special thanks are due to Sheila Shull, California Institute of Technology,
for her cheerful assistance in the distribution of \AUTO over a long period
of time.
Over the years, the development of \AUTO has been supported by
various agencies through the California Institute of Technology.
Work on this updated version was supported by a general research
grant from NSERC (Canada).

The development of {\cal HomCont} has much benefitted from  various pieces 
of help and advice from, among others, 
W.-J. Beyn, Universit\"{a}t Bielefeld,
M.~J. Friedman, University of Alabama,
A. Rucklidge, University of Cambridge, 
M. Koper, University of Utrecht and 
C.~J. Budd, University of Bristol. 
Financial support for collaboration was received from the U.K.\
Engineering and Physical Science Research Council and the Nuffield Foundation.
