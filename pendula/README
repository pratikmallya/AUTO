 This directory contains an animation program for the motion of
 coupled pendula. Compatible data are generated by the demo `pen'.
 To run the animation, first execute all three demo runs of `pen' in
 a user directory. Then type

                     @pn pen

 A rubber-band window will appear. Size the window as desired
 and then type the letter "l" in the window. A pop-up window
 will appear in which a labeled solution from the AUTO data
 file q.pen can be selected. To select another solution type
 "l" again. To exit type <ESC>.

 This directory also contains a data file q.2 with a variety
 of pendula motions discussed in the reference below. To view
 these motions, copy the file q.2 to your work directory and type

                    @p2 2        ( or @pn 2 )

 and then proceed as above.

 A similar animation program for three pendula can be viewed
 by copying the file q.3 to your work directory and then typing

                    @p3 3
